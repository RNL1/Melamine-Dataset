The Melamine dataset comprises Fourier-transform near infrared (FT-NIR) absorbance spectra and turbidity point readings of Melamine Formaldehyde recorded during condensation (i.e. polymerization) at Metadynea GmbH (Krems, Austria). The former are recorded in-line through a fibre optical probe while the latter are measured offline by determination of the turbidity point, i.e.  the temperature at which the condensate starts to get turbid. The turbidity point is a measure of polymer length and amount of cross-linking (i.e.  the degree of polymerization) and is an important  quantity  that  defines  the  physical  and  chemical  properties  of  the  final  resin. 

The  dataset  comprises recordings on several batches from 4 different recipes that use different raw material ratios and/or additives (see table). The NIR spectra are divided in two spectral ranges 5546 - 6254 and 6596 - 6975 (1/cm) comprising 225 and 121 input variables, respectively. The spectra corresponding to recipes 568 and 861 are shown in the top figure.
